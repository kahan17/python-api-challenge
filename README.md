# Python API Challenge

## Project Overview
This project uses Python and public APIs to gather weather data for city-level analysis. The aim is to analyze weather patterns globally and explore correlations between geographical factors and weather conditions. By utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, the project provides valuable insights into climate trends, helping to understand how geographical location impacts various weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and cloudiness.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to address how weather conditions vary across different geographic locations and uncover trends that can be useful for weather forecasting, environmental planning, and travel-related decision-making.

## Key Features
- Retrieves real-time weather data for multiple cities.
- Visualizes the relationships between geographic coordinates and weather attributes.
- Provides trend analysis on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Requests)
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Jupyter Notebooks
